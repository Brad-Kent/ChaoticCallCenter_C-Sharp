I have nothing but praise for Optus since starting a plan with them four months ago, Samsung Galaxy S7 plan, $0 upfront and reasonable monthly fees for what you get, including tons of data shareable across multiple plans, Optus Sport with EPL Live for FREE, cheap movie tickets, 4G service I have had no problems with in the Melbourne metro region, and an easy to use billing system. Overall a great mobile provider I cannot fault.
-
ad a minor problem with retrieving my modem Optus sent me. Made 1 phone call. They helped me straight away. Went into Optus Highpoint and Gloria in there gave me the best service one could hope for. Didn't try to sell me anything I didn't want and helped me beyond leaps and bounds with anything and everything I needed to know. Well done Optus!
Great improved network. Iâ€™m on postpaid plan. value for money. The service has improved over the years. Company is innovative coming up with new plans and products.
-
Optus mobile always have great offers for mobiles.
They generally give options for the user to sign onto a new contract with a new phone before contract plan ends.

They also provide loyalty bonuses to certain products of theirs.
The thing I've learnt with Optus is the you must speak to the "right" staff.
If you get an operator that's customer service is poor or doesn't have any ability to accomplish tasks, then change to speak with someone else.
It's the minority of operators who doesn't care or haven't received enough training to answer your call properly.
Other than that, Optus may not be the cheapest at times but they have been servicing my 4 mobiles for the last 20 years fine.

After using Telstra for several years, I finally decided to make the switch, because I was fed up with bad support and constant issues. A family member recommended Optus and I've been nothing but satisfied with them. A lot of people refuse to use Optus because they believe their coverage isn't any good, but this just isn't true anymore. Optus have made huge improvements to their networks in the past decade, and their coverage is mostly just as good as Telstra. I've found their customer support to be much better than Telstra too. I used their li ve chat when I was setting up my phone number and they were extremely helpful, walking me through the process. I've also found their 'My Account' feature to be a huge benefit, allowing me to check my usage and pay my bills at any time, online. Overall, I would recommend Optus to anyone looking for a decent phone company.
-
I was extremely unhappy about the way Optus's credit team handled their customer today, as if Optus doesn't care about their customer. I walked into the Optus store at Melbourne Central to register for a SIM-only plan, and had to come back TWICE to get all the papers the credit team demanded, then got rejected for no reason at all!! Fine, if you don't need your customers, I'm signing up with Telstra or someone else. I had a much much better experience with the TPG team months ago! Would highly dis-recommend Optus to any prospective customers!!
-
I got charged twice for one transaction and was told that a refund would be sorted out for me... Took me five calls to customer service over the span of two months to get that refund back, all because the first four assured me a refund would be done but just left notes on my account and never did anything about it. On top of that a good three of those customer service workers didn't believe me when I said I was charged twice. just kept asking "are you sure? can you check your statement again?".
-
Having never dealt with any Customer Service staff I can't comment.
Joined online, sim arrived by post and was easy to activate and port existing number.
Reception/Service quality is ok for my area, better in CBD areas.
4G often drops out and on some days for no particular reason runs very slow when using data.
Phone calls and texts all seem to be fine. No real complaints there.

Data allowances and speed could certainly be improved.

Cost of monthly packages also could be reviewed.
It is cheaper the more you buy, but I'm not prepared to commit to a 365-day plan on an average service provider without guarantee or refund options.
-
You get excellent value for money and the reception is really good - I've never had any problem. I've recommended Kogan mobile to all my friends and family.
-
After 20 days if you do not recharge your phone it is barred from incoming calls and texts. If it wasn't for that I would stay with them some months i don't need to use my mobile and can stretch having people call me or use my house phone, but 20 days is ridiculous so they have lost me as a customer. Especially as they didn't warn me of this and had no clue until i tried ringing my phone to find it and had call restrictions answering my call instead of my phone ringing.
-
I have no issues with the plan values but the reminders about recharging is a bit slack and if u own a iPhone the data goes really quickly other than that there is no other issue
-
Poor service no one ever seems to know what is happening.
Too many unresolved issues to mention.
They refuse to document any conversations.
Technically this is the worst data coverage and connections.
Typically over promise and under-deliver.

Use at your own risk.
-
Coverage in the Country is a bit hard to get phone calls, all in all the City is great, My plan is for 12month.
-
I have a prepaid plan. The coverage is good and found it it to be good value for money among other unlimited call options.
I'm very satisfied and have found the support to be helpful.
-
While in the city it works okay. If we go to the country area start having problems with the network. I have a prepaid plan which works well for me.
-
Haven't had a problem with your service so far. I am on a prepaid plan & so is my son. Coverage in rural NSW is pretty bad though. Couldn't fault the cost of the plan - excellent!!
The only thing I will say about Kogan is that I love receiving your marketing emails however there are way too many - and to the point where I want to "unsubscribe" to them as it is just a huge overkill on the marketing side of things.
-
good network coverage,
prepaid
yes it is value for money bust need some more data
did not contact customer services since i join the network
-
It's definitely my plan is value for money.
I am completely satisfied with it and have been recommending to my friends.
-
no problems so far with network coverage, cheapest prepaid plan ever, never had to call customer service or support which is a good thing. Only downside is to make an international call you have to purchase an add on. But there are other ways to make those calls so can't complain too much.
-
Talk service ok.

Every time i try and send txt message i get a notification it failed (90% of times). Try again, notificafion failed. Keep trying...failed.
Exactly the same thing happens to my partner who is on the same network.

Sometimes the recipient gets the message even though we are notified of a failure...embarrassing when they have received it 3 times even though you have had 3 fail notifications!!!

Moved to cmobile from slimtel who went in to receivership. Bad choice. Worst network experience ever.
-
On a red plan and getting hardly any coverage where I am located which is a regional town. Calls dropping out and as for internet, well zilch! Not even one bar on the H+ symbol! Rubbish
-
Quick to set up, with help from the customer service to choose the right plan we were able to get a service which is just right as an emergency phone. Yes, each call and text costs but there is no monthly fee and the credit on the account lasts for a year.
-
Friendly and helpful customer service, good coverage and fair price. Just what I needed for a six month stay in Australia. I have no experience with other Australian tele companies, so cannot really compare, but I can highly recommend Cmobile.
-
They have one of best "pay as you go" plans I've ever seen. If you don't use your phone very often but still need to be connected, go with their $0 per month plan, it's awesome. Their competitors seem to be amaysim and yomojo.

The only thing I'd like to see improved in the PAYG plan is for the billing unit of data to be reduced from 1MB to 1KB. This is a big deal, and could end up costing you if your phone sends lots of very small requests throughout the day. Yomojo bills per KB, so they might be worth checking out too (even though their per MB data price is higher, your bill may come out cheaper because of the rounding that cmobile does).

 Also has amazing customer service. Sometimes I get a reply within minutes! Simply amazing.

I'm going out of my way to put this review here because we need more telecom companies that are clear and honest. I really wish the best for this company. If you go with their service, you should leave a review also.
-
Being in business is never easy so much of your time is taken up with calls. Used to ring Telstra took ten calls to get the someone, and then five diversions. With BT I know the team they know my team. Thank you for the great service.
-
Don't consider this company, just turn away and run.
Terrible customer service. Rude. Owners are worse than the employers. Especially the director [name removed].
They charge what they want when they want without any explanation and you will never get any answers or a refund and if you do push it you will then be blackmailed. TIO should close them down.
-
once again we have lost our mobile and data service, 10 months in a row, no surprise, seriously the worst service or company I have been involved with in 30 years of business. So further investigation and they have also TAKEN $10K from my account. NO REASON, NO COMMUNICATION, NO RESPONSE FROM THEM. Reported to the TIO and if not sorted soon it will become a Police matter as well.
STAY AWAY FROM THEM !!!

This company has sadly affected our business, we chose to support a smaller business whom appeared to focus on customer service. Until we signed the contract and became a customer. Then the real issues started. Failed services, extortionate costs, an incredibly rude selection of employees, all focused on being as unhelpful as possible. This company makes the rules as it goes along, bending and weaving like a pro boxer, instead of helping the customer, your made to feel a fool, whom is wasting the service providers time, with genuine grievan ces. If there were an award for WORST customer service in Australia, this is the company that would be in a league of its own. And the winner is Best Telecom. Sadly they have taken a word BEST in their name, but if they were honest to the market, it would say, WORST Telecom, we are what we say we are.. The Worst. Be very careful any whom are at first taken in by the friendly Director/s, it lasts the moments he sells you, and then he grabs your airtime and becomes the rude queen/wicked witch. I feel duped that we put our faith in this company, don't make our mistake, go to a more reputable company whom can fix service faults and will not hold emails and web domains to ransom. Shame on you BEST TELECOM for failing in your duty of care. Do all Australians a favour and get an administrator in.

I worked for these crooks a few years ago & left because I did not approve of some of the company's unethical & downright rude tactics. I was never paid all that was owing to me when I left but it was worth every cent to free myself from the rude & nasty crooks.
-
Signed up, had constantly slow internet with unending cut-outs. When called to complain they wanted to charge for looking at the problem, or it wasn't their business hours. Finally got sick of it and cancelled, $110 fee even when out of contract.
-
I cannot believe how much I am paying per month for barely using my phone. I even get slug a $13 late payment fee for being 1 day late. Let's not forget I hardly use the phone, so they are making a killing from me.
In regards to service...forget it. It took me weeks and many phone calls and many emails just to get ownership transferred.
Stay away.

Just been connected to MATE on Monday only a few days after ordering and it was installed within an hour.
My only complaint is that I ordered 100/40 but I'm only getting around 17mbps.
-
Australian owned & operated. These guys are the real deal. My connection is ADSL. Set up was simple. Reliable service & their support is so easy compared to TPG, WestnetHomePhone, Iprimus who I dealt with before. Also, I don't get rubbish overseas marketers ringing me, maybe because they are Aussie based & have not sold off my personal details. There is no contract so what have you got to lose. If they don't meet your expectations then switch at the end of the month. So simple.

Iv'e just had the NBN connected by MATE, i'm very happy with their excellent customer service. All connected & working within 6 working days with no issues. MATE continuously kept me informed of the progress by SMS & email. I bought a modem through them and it was already configured and ready to go. With in one hour of the the Telstra tech checking the line i received a sms from MATE to say every thing was right to go. The speed seems good with no issues so far and the wireless works well all through the house.

The guy i dealt with was Fran k, he was nice to deal with and everything he said i would get i got and what would happen did happen. I would rate them 100% on there honesty and customer service (there was no crap story's).

I have several work colleges who have gone with different NBN providers & there always complaining about the speed, the dropouts and the charges. I would highly recommend MATE to anyone.
-
Connected 3 weeks after sign up, process was easy, customer service was very realistic with the time frame as our phone line had to be connected first (telstra). MATE kept us up to date with progress. Modem arrived once connection was active, plugged modem in and worked almost perfect, quick call with customer service and all set up.

Not the greatest speed to peak times, but in general quiet reliable for general use.

1 Stars off for the misleading advertising: No Activation Fees. We had to pay an activation fee of $69 (so telsta can acti vate our line). Adds up, as the modem costs $150 plus $70 activation fee.

1 Star off for poor choice of payment options. Direct debit only, not good enough.

In general very satisfied due to the fantastic and responsive customer service.

Signed up, need to speak to someone about the status of application. Rang them, but they can't put me through to someone to speak. Cannot put me in switchboard to speak to required department. Ironic that mate communicate doesn't have their communication systems in order. Looking for other providers.
-
I recently joined Mate via an FTTN service. My experience so far- with a little under two months of service- show that the NBN is offten slow and very regularly drops out and drop outs mean no internet but more importantly NO telephone!! What telecommunication provider thinks that's ok? I asked NBN Co about the drop outs affecting the phone and their response stated they have no plans to rectify it.
However, Mate have been great! They are swift to get onto any fault( and they have been numerous) and in my opinion Mate are doing a fantastic job to make an inferior product- the NBN- look like a reasonable set up ( of which it isn't).

Connected with Boom Broadband after reading reviews here and in other places on the internet. Their website is simple and straightforward and there were no hidden costs. Get a quote before you start though because you may need a modem or other accessories. Had some teething troubles in setting up but part of this was due to the NBN work schedule being delayed. Internet speed is generally at the expected level apart from high volume times such as late Fri/Sat night but it is still adequate. Phill and Jason are always available to talk,patient a nd always helpful. Payment is easy and plans are clearly set out. I still get the occasional dropout though which lasts a minute or so once a day but I don't think it would be any different for any other provider. In general, Boom are a trustworthy, reliable provider who provide a generally consistent service and good backup. The NBN FTTN is not a perfect system. Boom is as good as it gets in an imperfect system.
-
Genuinely the best company I have ever encountered. Flawless internet and customer service. Not only did they not charge a disconnection fee because of the plan I'm on but they gave me a refund because I paid for my next bill early and wouldnt be using the service for that time.
-
Great internet and staff, I'm very satisfied with the service. My plan is tier-2 ( 25/5 ) unlimited data which is great for video gaming and Netflix. I strongly recommend Boom broadband NBN, it's worth each cent you pay.
